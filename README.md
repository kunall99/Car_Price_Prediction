# Car_Price_Prediction
This is a car prediction problem. This model takes the data of various cars.    
This solution is based on the random forest.  
First I have explored the data and gather the useful information from the data  
After this I have used RandomizedSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.  
Then I used the random forest model for making the model and making the further predicitons.  

# Running the model
For running the model i suggest you to make a new python environment and install the requirements.txt file.  
After installing the requirement.txt run the "main.py"  

# Some useful commands
Creating a new env - "conda create -n env_name python=3.6"  
Activating the environmrnt - "activate env_name"  
Installing the requirements.txt - "pip install -r requirements.txt"  
Running the app.py - "streamlit run main.py"
